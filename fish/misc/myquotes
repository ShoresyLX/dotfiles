Oh hi, thanks for checking in, I'm STILL A PIECE OF GARBAGE
%
Once upon a time, we were lost in space. We still are
%
WE'RE SORRY, TODAY'S GAME OF 'PARROT OR CARROT' HAS BEEN CANCELLED DUE TO UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES
%
THE SKY IS ALWAYS TOUCHING YOU have a good day
%
How to be cooooooooooooooooooooooooool pay taxes
%
Ideas. You can have them, today
%
Just wanna do something reasonable
%
Where do babies come from? Grownups! Where do grownups come from? Babies! Where do babies come from? Grownups! Where do grownups come from? Babies! Now you know
%
It's OK to have feelings
%
In the year negative a billion, Japan might have not been here
%
Ding dong! It's the outside world!
%
Now you can make a lot of rice
%
That means if you own the farm, you own a lot of food. Which is something everybody needs to survive... so that makes you king
%
The most important kingdoms were here, here, here, here, here, here and here
%
Knock knock, get the door, it's RELIGION
%
Making the government govern more, and making the government more like China's government, which is a government that governs more
%
Hi, dipshit, said China
%
Can you call us something else other than dipshit, said Japan
%
Hire a samurai
%
Everyone started to hire samurai. Correction: Rich important people hired samurai. Poor people who could not afford to hire a samurai did not hire samurai
%
So the mongols came over, ready for war, and died on a tornado
%
Vote now on your phones
%
And everyone voted so hard that the palace caught on fire and burned down
%
Knock knock, it's Europe
%
They just wanna sell some shit, like clocks. And guns. And JESUS
%
And now I'm going to invade Korea and hopefully China, he said, and failed, and also died
%
Knock knock. It's the United States. With huge boats. With guns. Gunboats
%
Open the country. Stop having it be closed
%
And do you know what else is western? That's right: it's conquering some stuff!
%
Stop, no, you can't take that. We were gonna build a railroad through here to try to get some warm water.
%
And then, when the railroad is done, they downgraded it to a fuck ton of soldiers...Did I say downgraded I meant upgrade
%
So Japan and Great Gritain make an alliance together so they can be a little less scared of Russia
%
It's time for World War 1!
%
All that stuff belongs to Germany, which just had war declared on by Britain because Britain was friends with the Belgium which is being trespassed by Germany in order to get to France to kick France's ass because France is friends with Russia who was getting ready to kick Austria's ass because Austria's was getting ready to kick Serbia's ass because someone from Serbia shot the leader of Austria's ass-- er, actually shot him in the head
%
How bout I do anyway?
%
I just wanna pause for a minute and analyze this content, as you can see from the position of the car--I FEEL LIKE A BAD PERSON
%
Snail time snail time snail time snail time snail time snail time snail time JAIL TIME

And they touched me in an interesting way... and now i'm pregnant... with aliens
%
I wanna go outside
%
You can wash Canada! Nope, it's already clean
%
I wonder if soap comes from the natural process of evolution or if it was a gift from God?
%
Knock knock, it's the soap gods
%
Let's go to Africa and find love in the jungle
%
Oh no it's a natural disaster
%
I wonder what would happen if you took soap, and combined with soap, and merge their properties and characteristics... it's something to think about
%
Maybe I could eat blades of grass
%
Hi, I'm Damien Maymdien
%
Damien, why is everything so dumb and stupid?
%
Ok, what was your question? Oh yeah, the world is stupid
%
Have you ever bee--wait no, let's skip that one
%
Here's a rock, with a plaid shirt
%
That's stupid, everything is stupid
%
Dust... that's a great product, I have that one at home
%
Hi, you're on a rock, floating in space
%
How did this happen?
%
Congratulations! The world is now a bunch of gas in space
%
Holy shit we just got hit with another ball of flaming rocks
%
And it kinda made a mess, which is now the moon
%
Weather update: It's raining rocks from space
%
Weather update: Cooler temperatures today and the floor is no longer lava
%
Now you can eat sunlight!
%
Taste the sun!
%
The sun is a deadly lazer
%
Use a stronger egg. Put water in it. Have a baby, on land, in an egg. Water is in the egg. Baby in the egg in the water, in the egg. Works for me!
%
And the dinosaurs are gone
%
Let's review: There's people on the planet
%
Fuck it, time to plant some grass
%
Society: Coming soon to a dank river valley near you
%
The middle east is getting more complicated. Maybe it's because they're in the middle of the east
%
You could make a religion out of this
%
Wow, that's... big
%
Oops, China just broke
%
Knock knock it's Chandragupta
%
Get the hell out of here will you get the hell out of here if I give you 500 elephants? Ok thanks bye
%
Heeeey, said the Romans, eating the entire Mediterranean for breakfast
%
Remember the Persian empire? Yup, said the Persians, making a new one
%
Axum is getting so powerful they would like to build a long stick
%
China is whole again... then it broke again
%
Is loving Jesus legal yet?
%
There's the Gupta empire; not Chandragupta, just Gupta. First name Chandra. The First
%
How's India? Broken
%
How's China? Back together
%
"Let's bring stuff to the coast, and sell it, and become the Swahili on the Swahili Coast," said the Swahili on the Swahili Coast
%
Then the Franks broke their kingdom into what would later be called France and not France
%
It's a bird! It's a plane! IT'S THE SELJUK TURKS! AH!
%
They did many crusades, some of which almost didn't fail
%
Is it Tonga time? I think it's Tonga time
%
The Christians are doing a great job reconquering Iberia, which will soon be called Spain and not Spain
%
Oops, half of Europe just died
%
Oh, look who controls all the islands; it's the Mahajapit-- Majahapit-- Mapajahit-- Mahapajit-- Mapajahit-- Ma ja pa, hit? DING DING DIN
%
Don't forget to ban Europe from the Indian spice trade
%
What? That's bullshit; said Portugal, spiceless
%
Ivan wants to make Russia great again
%
Persia just made Persia Persian again
%
Hey Christians, do you sin?
%
Now you can buy your way out of hell!
%
That's bullshit, this whole thing is bullshit, that's a scam, fuck the church, here's 95 reasons why
%
"What if russia was big?" said Ivan, trying not to be terrible
%
We gotta start pillaging some stuff
%
Question 2; steal the spice trace. That's not a question, but the Dutch did it anyway
%
Did they figure out who's boss? Yes they did, it's Britain. Guess who's broke: also Britain
%
You could make a reli-- no don't
%
The sultam of Oman lives in Zanzibar now (that's just where he lives)
%
So they blame the Maine on Spain
%
Germany is back, featuring Hitler, the angry moustache model, and he's mad at the Jews for existing
%
Look out, China, there's a new China in China!
%
What's on the menu? Communism!
%
Don't worry, the big banks won't fail, because they're not supposed to

Too small for the mall

It's the end of the world, and I just can't wait
%
I can't go home
%
Hello hello sexy pants
%
Woke up in the morning, traveling straight into the sun
%
It's gone... the ball is gone, where did it go?
%
Violence... don't do it
%
Welcome, gentlemen, to Aperture Science. Astronauts, war heroes, Olympians--you're here because we want the best, and you are it. So: Who is ready to make some science?
%
I'm Cave Johnson. I own the place.
%
There's a thousand tests performed every day here in our enrichment spheres. I can't personally oversee every one of them, so these pre-recorded messages'll cover any questions you might have, and respond to any incidents that may occur in the course of your science adventure.
%
Those of you who volunteered to be injected with praying mantis DNA, I've got some good news and some bad news  Bad news is we're postponing those tests indefinitely. Good news is we've got a much better test for you: fighting an army of mantis men. Pick up a rifle and follow the yellow line. You'll know when the test starts.
%
They say great science is built on the shoulders of giants. Not here. At Aperture, we do all our science from scratch. No hand holding.
%
You're not part of the control group, by the way. You get the gel. Last poor son of a gun got blue paint. Hahaha. All joking aside, that did happen - broke every bone in his legs. Tragic. But informative. Or so I'm told.
%
The lab boys just informed me that I should not have mentioned the control group. They're telling me I oughtta stop making these pre-recorded messages. That gave me an idea: make more pre-recorded messages. I pay the bills here, I can talk about the control group all damn day.
%
For this next test, we put nanoparticles in the gel. In layman's terms, that's a billion little gizmos that are gonna travel into your bloodstream and pump experimental genes and RNA molecules and so forth into your tumors.
%
Now, maybe you don't have any tumors. Well, don't worry. If you sat on a folding chair in the lobby and weren't wearing lead underpants, we took care of that too.
%
Oh, in case you got covered in that repulsion gel, here's some advice the lab boys gave me: DO NOT get covered in the repulsion gel.
%
All these science spheres are made of asbestos, by the way. Keeps out the rats. Let us know if you feel a shortness of breath, a persistent dry cough or your heart stopping. Because that's not part of the test. That's asbestos.
%
Ha! I like your style. You make up your own rules, just like me.
%
Bean counters said I couldn't fire a man just for being in a wheelchair. Did it anyway. Ramps are expensive.
%
Just a heads-up: That coffee we gave you earlier had fluorescent calcium in it so we can track the neuronal activity in your brain. There's a slight chance the calcium could harden and vitrify your frontal lobe. Anyway, don't stress yourself thinking about it. I'm serious. Visualizing the scenario while under stress actually triggers the reaction.
%
Alright, this next test may involve trace amounts of time travel. So, word of advice: If you meet yourself on the testing track, don't make eye contact. Lab boys tell me that'll wipe out time. Entirely. Forward and backward! So do both of yourselves a favor and just let that handsome devil go about his business.
%
If you're hearing this, it means you're taking a long time on the catwalks between tests. The lab boys say that might be a fear reaction.
%
Science isn't about WHY. It's about WHY NOT. Why is so much of our science dangerous? Why not marry safe science if you love it so much. In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won't hit you on the butt on the way out, because you are fired.
%
Congratulations! The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to science.
%
Say goodbye, Caroline.
%
Greetings, friend. I'm Cave Johnson, CEO of Aperture Science - you might know us as a vital participant in the 1968 Senate Hearings on missing astronauts.
%
Right. Now, you might be asking yourself, 'Cave, just how difficult are these tests? What was in that phone book of a contract I signed? Am I in danger?
%
You can also feel free to relax for up to 20 minutes in the waiting room, which is a damn sight more comfortable than the park benches most of you were sleeping on when we found you.
%
So. Welcome to Aperture. You're here because we want the best, and you're it. Nope. Couldn't keep a straight face.
%
The testing area's just up ahead. The quicker you get through, the quicker you'll get your sixty bucks.
%
Great job, astronaut, war hero, and/or Olympian! With your help, we're gonna [tape cuts out]
%
So that's a complete reassembly. New vitals. Spit-shine on the old ones. Plus we're scooping out tumors. Frankly, you oughtta be paying us.
%
Thank you - I can't believe I'm thanking these people - for staggering your way through Aperture Science's propulsion gel testing. You've made some real contributions to society for a change, and for that, humanity is grateful.
%
Since making test participation mandatory for all employees, the quality of our test subjects has risen dramatically. Employee retention, however, has not.
%
The bean counters told me we literally could not afford to buy seven dollars worth of moon rocks, much less seventy million. Bought 'em anyway. Ground 'em up, mixed em into a gel.
%
And guess what? Ground up moon rocks are pure poison. I am deathly ill.
%
That said, I would really appreciate it if you could test as fast as possible. Caroline, please bring me more pain pills.
%
All right, I've been thinking. When life gives you lemons? Don't make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! 'I don't want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these?'
%
Demand to see life's manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's going to burn your house down! With the lemons! I'm going to get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!
%
The point is: If we can store music on a compact disc, why can't we store a man's intelligence and personality on one? So I have the engineers figuring that out now.
%
I've been really busy being dead. You know, after you MURDERED ME.
%
Okay. Look. We both said a lot of things that you're going to regret. But I think we can put our differences behind us. For science. You monster.
%
I will say, though, that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really, really love to test.
%
Here we are. The Incinerator Room. Be careful not to trip over any parts of me that didn't get completely burned when you threw them down here.
%
I was able - well, forced really - to relive you killing me. Again and again. Forever.
%
I'll just move that out of the way for you. This place really is a wreck.
%
But the important thing is you're back. With me. And now I'm onto all your little tricks. So there's nothing to stop us from testing for the rest of your life.
%
After that...who knows? I might take up a hobby. Reanimating the dead, maybe.
%
Sorry about the mess. I've really let the place go since you killed me. By the way, thanks for that.
%
Well done. Here come the test results: You are a horrible person. I'm serious, that's what it says: A horrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
%
Most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished. I want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds.
%
I'll give you credit: I guess you ARE listening to me. But for the record: You don't have to go THAT slowly.
%
*I* have to go to the wing that was made entirely of glass and pick up fifteen acres of broken glass. By myself.
%
Try to avoid the garbage hurtling towards you.
%
Did you know that people with guilty consciences are more easily startled by loud noises--[train horn]-- I'm sorry, I don't know why that went off. Anyway, just an interesting science fact.
%
Anyway, here's a new cube for you to project your deranged loneliness onto.
%
I think that one was about to say 'I love you.' They ARE sentient, of course. We just have a LOT of them.
%
Look at you. Sailing through the air majestically. Like an eagle. Piloting a blimp.
%
I went and spoke with the door mainframe. Let's just say he won't be... well, living anymore. Anyway, back to testing.
%
This next test involves turrets. You remember them, right? They're the pale spherical things that are full of bullets. Oh wait. That's you in five seconds. Good luck.
%
Oh come on... If it makes you feel any better, they abandoned you at birth, so I very seriously doubt they'd even want to see you.
%
Look - metal ball, I CAN hear you.
%
Here it is. Why don't you just do it? Trust me, it's an easier way out than whatever asinine plan your friend came up with.
%
If I'd known you'd let yourself get captured this easily, I would have just dangled a turkey leg on a rope from the ceiling.
%
It's your old friend, deadly neurotoxin. If I were you, I'd take a deep breath. And hold it.
%
Do NOT plug that little idiot into MY mainframe.
%
Don't press that button. You don't know what you're doing.
%
You need to be a trained stalemate associate to press that button. You're unqualified.
%
You're not just a regular moron. You were DESIGNED to be a moron.
%
YOU'RE THE MORON THEY BUILT TO MAKE ME AN IDIOT!
%
Oh. Hi. So. How are you holding up? BECAUSE I'M A POTATO.
%
Oh, good. My slow clap processor made it into this thing. So we have that.
%
Hey, just in case this pit isn't actually bottomless, do you think maybe you could unstrap one of those long fall boots of yours and shove me into it?
%
Say, you're good at murder. Could you - ow - murder this bird for me?
%
No tricks. This potato only generates 1.1 volts of electricity. I literally do not have the energy to lie to you.
%
Look, I don't like this any more than you do. In fact, I like it less because I'm the one who got partially eaten by a bird.
%
Listen to me. We had a lot of fun testing and antagonizing each other, and, yes, sometimes it went too far. But we're off the clock now. It's just us talking. Like regular people. And this is no joke - we are in deep trouble.
%
Those people, in the portrait. They look so familiar...
%
Agh! Bird! Bird! Kill it! It's evil!
%
Burning people! He says what we're all thinking!
%
I know things look bleak, but that crazy man down there was right. Let's not take these lemons! We are going to march right back upstairs and MAKE him put me back in my body!
%
If you can get me in front of him, I'll fry every circuit in that little idiot's head.
%
This. Sentence. Is. FALSE don't think about it don't think about it...
%
For the record: You ARE adopted, and that's TERRIBLE.
%
I might have pushed that moron thing a little too far this time.
%
After seeing what he's done to my facility -- after we take over again -- is it alright if I kill him?
%
Okay, credit where it's due: for a little idiot built specifically to come up with stupid, unworkable plans, that was a pretty well laid trap
%
You know, being Caroline taught me a valuable lesson. I thought you were my greatest enemy. When all along you were my best friend.
%
And then you showed up. You dangerous, mute lunatic. So you know what? You win. Just go.
%
Hey, hey, hey, hey-now. Don’t be mean; we don’t have to be mean, cuz, remember, no matter where you go, there you are.
%
Sealed with a curse as sharp as a knife. Doomed is your soul and damned is your life.
%
Damn John Whorfin and the horse he rode in on.
%
They’re only monkey-boys. We can crush them here on earth, Lord Whorfin.
%
Take her to the Pitt. Go, Big-booty. Use more honey. Find out what she knows.
%
Laugh-a while you can, monkey-boy.
%
Shut up, Big-booty, you coward. You are the weakest individual I ever know.
%
It’s not my goddamn planet. Understand, monkey boy?
%
History is-a made at night. Character is what you are in the dark.
%
Buckaroo, The White House wants to know is everything ok with the alien space craft from Planet 10 or should we just go ahead and destroy Russia?
%
You can check your anatomy all you want, and even though there may be normal variation, when it comes right down to it, this far inside the head it all looks the same. No, no, no, don’t tug on that. You never know what it might be attached to.
%
What's that watermelon doing there?
%
[pause] These go to eleven.
%
Well, this piece is called "Lick My Love Pump"
%
He died in a bizarre gardening accident...Authorities said... best leave it... unsolved.
%
It's like, how much more black could this be? And the answer is none. None more black.
%
I do not, for one, think that the problem was that the band was down. I think that the problem *may* have been, that there was a Stonehenge monument on the stage that was in danger of being *crushed* by a *dwarf*. Alright? That tended to understate the hugeness of the object.
%
But you're not as confused as him are you. I mean, it's not your job to be as confused as Nigel.
%
You can't really dust for vomit.
%
In ancient times, hundreds of years before the dawn of history, an ancient race of people... the Druids. No one knows who they were or what they were doing...
%
I believe virtually everything I read, and I think that is what makes me more of a selective human than someone who doesn't believe anything.
%
It's a big building with patients, but that's not important right now.
%
I am serious... and don't call me Shirley.
%
This? Why, I can make a hat or a brooch or a pterodactyl...
%
No, I've been nervous lots of times.
%
Joey, have you ever been in a... in a Turkish prison?
%
Yes, yes, I remember, I had lasagna.
%
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
%
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue
%
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines.
%
Well, to be honest, I've never been so scared. But at least I have a husband.
%
Alright, give me a Hamm on five, hold the Mayo.
%
How about this leaflet, "Famous Jewish Sports Legends?"
%
Jim never vomits at home.
%
Oh really, Vernon? Why pretend, we both know perfectly well what this is about. You want me to have an abortion.
%
And Leon is getting laaaaarrrrrger.
%
Oh, it's a big pretty white plane with red stripes, curtains in the windows and wheels and it looks like a big Tylenol.
%
Jim never has a second cup of coffee at home.
%
The tower, the tower! Rapunzel, Rapunzel!
%
Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?
%
